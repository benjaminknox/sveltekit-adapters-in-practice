# SvelteKit Adapters in Practice

This is a repository that has a few examples of using SvelteKit with different adapters for my blog post [SvelteKit Adapters in Practice](https://ben-knox.com/post/sveltekit-adapters-in-practice).

The different adapters are:
- [Static Site](./static-site)
- [Chrome Extension](./chrome-extension)
- [Node Server](./node-server)
